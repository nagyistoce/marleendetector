#summary An Image Gallery Manager with face detection and recognition, written in Python.

= Marleen Detector =
The MarleenDetector is an Image Gallery Manager and with face detection and recognition modules.

= History =
This project was originally started because of a narcissistic friend of mine (Marleen ;-)) and we wanted to filter out her photographs. But after a beer-powered brainstorming session I decided the project had much more potential and should do more than recognize faces... It should use time-stamps, GPS, fun statistics and a lot of other cool stuff so me and my friends could finally use it to categorise all our photographs we ever made (approx 10000++).

= Overview =
The MarleenDetector uses several python libraries
 * PyCV, a Python library of OpenCV: http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/pham0004/pycv/
 * PyQt4, a GUI Toolkit for Python: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
